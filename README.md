# Code Review - "Portfolio Landing Page" - Week 1 - Intro To Programming - Epicodus - Portland, OR

#### _This is a final project for the first week of the Intro to Programming course at Epicodus in Portland., May 21, 2018_

#### By _**Kelli McCloskey**_

## Description

_The instructions for this project are as follows:_

#### "Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for your programming portfolio. Do not use a template to create your initial HTML and Bootstrap. Begin your work with an empty page and an initial empty commit. Your CSS stylesheet must be named styles.css and reside in a css directory. Your HTML file page must be called index.html. Your webpage should include the following content:

* Your name.
* An image of you, or something that represents you.
* A list of projects you have created with active links to their GitHub pages sites or GitHub repositories.
* For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses.
* An “About Me” section.
* Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc).
* Your current interests/hobbies/skills.
* Create a gh-pages branch so that your site can be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio (for example).
* Don't forget your Git commits with an initial commit and a commit for every major code change, and include a README in your GitHub repository!
