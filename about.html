      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello there, thanks for visiting my portfolio website. My name is Kelli Brooke and I live in Portland, Oregon. I graduated from the University of San Francisco in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in Media Studies, focusing on audio production with the goal of working in music event management. After a wild and crazy seven years working as an organizer in the music industry and traveling the world in the off season, I decided to abandon the unhealthy rock-n-roll lifestyle and study code. I call it growing up - on my own terms. I am currently studying C#, Javascript and React at Epicodus in Portland. Aside from coding, I enjoy riding my bike, cooking and tasting new foods, hiking, going to see live music and reading and writing prose and poetry.</p>
